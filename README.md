# Raumakustik App

This streamlit application delivers an estimation of the reverberation time in octave bands and an evaluation of the speech intelligibility for a room given by user inputs.

Users can enter the volume of the room and areas of surfaces and subsurfaces. Materials for these surfaces can be choosen from a database. Custom materials can be added to that database. Additionally a number of persons can be added to the rooms equivalent absorption surface. Speech intelligibilty can be evaluated for different use cases like ‘music’ or ‘education/communication’ as described in DIN 18041.

The calculations are based on statistical acoustics and implement the standards DIN EN 12354-6 and DIN 18041.
